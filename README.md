## Kandinsky as Preferred

“Kandinsky As You Preferred” introduces a generative approach that empowers users with a prompting-free experience to create their preferred painterly content with a large text-to-image model based solely on their aesthetic preferences. This repo hosts the code of our genetic algorithm and the dataset when working LoRA as well as our fine-tuned lora models.
